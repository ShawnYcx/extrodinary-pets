\-What to do\

-Who to buy from\
-What to expect

First of all, my words do not represent the voice for all the breeder / extreme hobbyist. This is simply my advice and opinion . If you are new to the hobby or already is then you might wanna read this.

If you are interested in getting a Leopard gecko. Please actually do your research through google or youtube to prepare for what it takes to keep a Leopard Gecko. If that is not enough for you or if you dont understand most of it . Please try ask around in this MLGC group. We have the most friendly and most informative community here and Im pretty sure most of them are more happy to help you on your way to become one of Us.

Once you finish your research it's time to hunt for your favorite Leopard Gecko morph. I suggest you peeps actually look for the reputable breeder in our community to ensure your Leopard Gecko keeping experience is safe , fun and happy.

Leopard Geckos price VARIES from the QUALITY of the MORPH itself , it's like buying a shitty looking car and a good looking car . I urge you peeps to not buy IMPULSIVELY as you see the price is CHEAP . GOOD STUFF IS NOT CHEAP so keep that in mind. In my experience buying cheap stuff from a non reputable breeder is not a big NO, but it always have the disadvantage being unknown morph information , unknown history of the leopard geckos and unknown hets that is in the gene of the Leopard Gecko itself. Always make sure the Leopard Geckos Genetic Information is accurate or near accurate when you purchase one . If you are going to breed one be prepare for the FUN and EXCITEMENT of the road to become a breeder.

Buying Leopard Gecko from a reputable breeder is like buying a product from a established brand of company. They provide good detail , they provide you their experience and they helps you along the way in your problem not like a hit and run business so you dont feel that you're out of way to solve your problem. Many may priced their animal at a low price but not all of them will help you with your problem, face it you paid for a low balling price ,what you expect a First Class treatment from them?

We are trying our very best to keep the hobby healthy , as long as you feel that you're in a pinch and dont know what to do , REMEMBER to always ask around because keeping a Leopard Gecko is a Learning Curve , most of us we keeps a handful of collection is still learning so dont expect you know everything but you are not alone.

Support Local Breeder is one way to keep the hobby healthy so our Local Breeder will thrive and improve to give you as much help as you need. Fact is , if you are always buying stuff from a shady seller with confusing background it will affect your breeding project , eventually the market will have less good looking animal for you to keep in your collection. Self explain , good stuff is not cheap , cheap stuff may not be good. Purchase the Leopard Geckos based on their beauty and not by the PRICE .

Here is some reputable breeder i recommend that i know with the morph they are working with :-

1. RoyalLex - Line Bred Super Hypo Tangerine
2. Gecko Island - WY Tremper / SHTCT / Rainwater
3. Horizon Geckos - WY Bell / WY Tremper / Tangerine Line
4. The Fabulous Geckos - WY Tremper / SHTCT / Emerines
5. Geckos.my - Bell / Tremper / SHTCT / ( African Fat Tail Gecko )

again this is solely my opinion you may not agree with it but i hope it provide some insights and guide you through your Leopard Gecko keeping experience! Lets make the community great and we welcome you to our community!

Cheers Peeps! -->
